    How Neovim integrates Lua
      - :help lua-guide
      - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

Kickstart Guide:
  Work through and read the rest of the the file init.lua!
  Next, run AND READ `:help`.
    This will open up a help window with some basic information
    about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.
